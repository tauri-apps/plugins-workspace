## Default Permission

This set of permissions describes the what kind of
file system access the `fs` plugin has enabled or denied by default.

#### Granted Permissions

This default permission set enables read access to the
application specific directories (AppConfig, AppData, AppLocalData, AppCache,
AppLog) and all files and sub directories created in it.
The location of these directories depends on the operating system,
where the application is run.

In general these directories need to be manually created
by the application at runtime, before accessing files or folders
in it is possible.

Therefore, it is also allowed to create all of these folders via
the `mkdir` command.

#### Denied Permissions

This default permission set prevents access to critical components
of the Tauri application by default.
On Windows the webview data folder access is denied.



- `create-app-specific-dirs`
- `read-app-specific-dirs-recursive`
- `deny-default`
