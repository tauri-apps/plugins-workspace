Save filesystem and asset scopes and restore them when the app is reopened.

## Install

_This plugin requires a Rust version of at least **1.65**_

There are three general methods of installation that we can recommend.

1. Use crates.io and npm (easiest, and requires you to trust that our publishing pipeline worked)
2. Pull sources directly from Github using git tags / revision hashes (most secure)
3. Git submodule install this repo in your tauri project and then use file protocol to ingest the source (most secure, but inconvenient to use)

Install the Core plugin by adding the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

`src-tauri/Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
tauri-plugin-persisted-scope = { git = "https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace", branch = "v2" }
```

## Usage

First you need to register the core plugin with Tauri:

`src-tauri/src/main.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    tauri::Builder::default()
        .plugin(tauri_plugin_persisted_scope::init())
        .run(tauri::generate_context!())
        .expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

Afterwards the plugin will automatically save and restore filesystem and asset scopes.
