# Torch

Control the device flashlight (torch) on Android and iOS.

On Android, turning on the torch while another component holds the camera normally fails. This plugin also works while a [barcode scanner](../barcode-scanner) scan is running, so apps can offer a flashlight button in their scanning UI.

## Install

_This plugin requires a Rust version of at least **1.90**_

There are three general methods of installation that we can recommend.

1. Use crates.io and npm (easiest, and requires you to trust that our publishing pipeline worked)
2. Pull sources directly from Github using git tags / revision hashes (most secure)
3. Git submodule install this repo in your tauri project and then use file protocol to ingest the source (most secure, but inconvenient to use)

Install the Core plugin by adding the following to your `Cargo.toml` file:

`src-tauri/Cargo.toml`

```toml
[dependencies]
tauri-plugin-torch = "2.0.0"
# alternatively with Git:
tauri-plugin-torch = { git = "https://github.com/tauri-apps/plugins-workspace", branch = "v2" }
```

You can install the JavaScript Guest bindings using your preferred JavaScript package manager:

<!-- Add the branch for installations using git! -->

```sh
pnpm add @tauri-apps/plugin-torch
# or
npm add @tauri-apps/plugin-torch
# or
yarn add @tauri-apps/plugin-torch
```

## Usage

First you need to register the core plugin with Tauri:

`src-tauri/src/lib.rs`

```rust
fn main() {
    tauri::Builder::default()
        .plugin(tauri_plugin_torch::init())
        .run(tauri::generate_context!())
        .expect("error while running tauri application");
}
```

Second, add the required permissions in the project:

`src-tauri/capabilities/default.json`

```json
  "permissions": ["torch:default"]
```

Afterwards all the plugin's APIs are available through the JavaScript guest bindings:

```javascript
import {
  enable,
  disable,
  toggle,
  isAvailable,
  isEnabled
} from '@tauri-apps/plugin-torch'

if (await isAvailable()) {
  await enable()
  console.log(await isEnabled()) // true
  await toggle() // returns false, the torch is now off
  await disable()
}
```

`isEnabled` reads the hardware state, so it also reflects the torch being turned off by the system, another app, or a barcode scan ending.
